        "The framework for generating and testing responses using the fine-tuned GPT-2 Large model is functional.\n",

        "\n",
        "**2. What Needs Improvement:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Repetition: The model often repeats phrases, which can be mitigated by adding diverse examples to the dataset and penalizing repetition during text generation using parameters like repetition_penalty in model.generate().\n",
        "\n",
        "* Precision: The responses need to be more specific and factually correct. Expanding the dataset with more curated and accurate examples can improve precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Garbled Output: Debug tokenization issues and ensure training data adequately covers diverse phrasing and detailed examples to address vague or garbled outputs."
